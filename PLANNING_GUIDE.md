# Planning Guide - Task Creation and Tracking

## Overview
This document serves as a guide for creating detailed, trackable tasks from documents and PRDs. Tasks should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Reference-able by ID
- Trackable with completion status
- Flexible in execution order

## Task Structure

### Task Format
```
## [CATEGORY] - [TASK_ID]: [Title]
**Status**: [ ] Pending | [X] Complete | [~] In Progress
**Priority**: High | Medium | Low
**Dependencies**: [List other task IDs if applicable]
**Estimated Time**: [Time estimate]

### Description
[Detailed description of what needs to be done]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

### References
- Document: [Link to relevant doc/section]
- Related Tasks: [Other task IDs]

### Notes
[Any additional context, gotchas, or considerations]
```

## Task Categories

### Infrastructure (INFRA)
- Database setup and migrations
- Server configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Environment configuration

### Backend (BE)
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- Data models
- Authentication/authorization

### Frontend (FE)
- UI components
- User flows
- State management
- Styling

### Testing (TEST)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Performance tests

### Documentation (DOC)
- API documentation
- User guides
- Technical documentation
- Code comments

### DevOps (DEVOPS)
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring setup
- Logging configuration
- Security hardening

## Task Tracking

### Status Types
- **[ ] Pending**: Not started
- **[~] In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **[X] Complete**: Finished and verified
- **[!] Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependency
- **[?] On Hold**: Temporarily paused

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Critical path, blocking other work
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice to have, can be deferred

## Planning Process

### 1. Document Analysis
- Read and understand all provided documents
- Identify key requirements and features
- Note dependencies between features
- Understand user flows and business logic

### 2. Task Decomposition
- Break down features into implementable chunks
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Ensure tasks have clear acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies between tasks

### 3. Task Organization
- Group related tasks by category
- Assign priorities based on business value and dependencies
- Number tasks for easy reference
- Create task hierarchy if needed

### 4. Review and Validation
- Ensure all requirements are covered
- Verify task granularity is appropriate
- Check that dependencies are correctly identified
- Validate acceptance criteria are testable

## Best Practices

### Task Creation
- Make tasks atomic (single responsibility)
- Include specific technical details
- Reference exact document sections
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

### Task Dependencies
- Clearly identify blocking relationships
- Consider both hard and soft dependencies
- Plan for parallel work where possible
- Account for shared resources

### Flexibility
- Tasks can be completed in any logical order
- Dependencies must be respected
- Priorities can be adjusted as needed
- Tasks can be broken down further if needed

## Example Task

```
## BE-001: User Authentication API
**Status**: [ ] Pending
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: INFRA-001 (Database setup)
**Estimated Time**: 3 hours

### Description
Implement JWT-based authentication system with login, logout, and token refresh endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] POST /auth/login endpoint accepts email/password
- [ ] Returns JWT token on successful authentication
- [ ] POST /auth/logout invalidates token
- [ ] POST /auth/refresh refreshes valid tokens
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid credentials
- [ ] Password hashing using bcrypt
- [ ] Rate limiting on login attempts

### References
- Document: auth_requirements.md, Section 3.2
- Related Tasks: BE-002 (Password reset), FE-005 (Login form)

### Notes
- Use 24-hour token expiration
- Implement refresh token rotation for security
- Consider implementing account lockout after 5 failed attempts
```

## Task Completion Guidelines

### Marking Complete
Only mark tasks complete when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is tested and working
- Documentation is updated
- Code is committed to repository

### Progress Updates
- Update status regularly
- Add notes about blockers or issues
- Update time estimates if needed
- Reference related discoveries or changes

## Review Process

### Regular Reviews
- Review task list weekly
- Update priorities based on business needs
- Add new tasks as requirements evolve
- Archive completed tasks periodically

### Retrospectives
- Analyze task estimation accuracy
- Identify common blockers
- Improve task decomposition process
- Update templates based on learnings
