# SaaS Platform Project Summary

## Project Overview

**Domain**: saas.unifiedaisolutions.com  
**Purpose**: Multi-tenant modular web portal platform for custom business applications  
**Development**: Claude Code will build the entire platform  
**Architecture**: Minimal, single-container deployment with modular app system  

## Business Model

### Core Concept
Create custom web portals for businesses that interact with databases and applications. Each business gets a unique portal based on their login credentials and enabled modules.

### Client Access Pattern
- **No Public Signup**: End customers cannot self-register
- **Super User Creation**: Unified AI Solutions creates super user accounts for each business
- **Delegated Management**: Super users create additional accounts within their organization
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels within each business

### Revenue Model
- **Custom Builds**: Initially built per client request
- **Modular Expansion**: Add new apps/features as needed
- **Service Conversion**: All custom builds eventually become standardized service offerings

## Technical Architecture

-- Core tables
businesses (id, name, domain, config)
users (id, email, business_id, role, permissions)
business_modules (business_id, module_name, enabled, config)

-- Module-specific tables (examples)
leads (id, business_id, name, email, status, ...)
crm_contacts (id, business_id, name, company, deals, ...)
documents (id, business_id, name, path, permissions, ...)
kanban_boards (id, business_id, name, columns, ...)
```

### Data Isolation
